\item Let the boy be at point $\vec{B}=\myvec{0\\0}$
\\
Initially, it was initially raining downward at speed of 35 $m s^{-1}$ and when there is wind, it is raining downward at speed of 12 $m s^{-1}$.
\\
Let the boy be at origin.
\\
Let $\vec{u}$ be the initial rain vector = $\myvec{0\\35}$
\\
Let $\vec{v}$ be the final rain vector = $\myvec{l\\12}$(Where l is real number, and speed of rain in vertical direction changed to 12$m s^{-1}$)
\\
$\norm{\vec{u}}=\norm{\vec{v}}=35m s^{-1}$(As the speed of rain remains constant)
The angle $\theta$ with the vertical, at which it is raining is calculated by:
\begin{align}
\vec{u}^T\vec{v}=\norm{\vec{u}}\norm{\vec{v}}\cos\theta
\\
\frac{12}{35}=\cos\theta
\\
\theta=69.96
\end{align}  
$\therefore$ Boy has to hold his umbrella at angle of $20.04 ^{\circ}$ with the ground towards east.
